Description: Implements an S4 class called sparse_numeric for representing
    numeric vectors in sparse form and provides arithmetic, summary, and
    plotting methods. Includes coercion helpers, operators for addition,
    subtraction, multiplication, dot products, standardization, norms, and
    visualization to work with sparse vectors without materializing dense
    representations.
