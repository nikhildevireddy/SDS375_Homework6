# sparseNumeric

![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/nikhildevireddy/SDS375_Homework6/actions/workflows/R-CMD-check.yaml/badge.svg)

`sparseNumeric` is an R package that implements an S4 class
(`sparse_numeric`) for representing sparse numeric vectors and performing
efficient operations on them without converting to a full dense
representation.

The package extends the code originally written for Homework 5 by adding:

- A complete R package structure  
- Additional sparse vector utilities (`mean`, `norm`, `standardize`)  
- Full roxygen2 documentation  
- Robust unit tests targeting ≥90% code coverage  
- Automated R CMD check via GitHub Actions  
- A pkgdown website (optional but recommended)
